# Conventional prelude toolchain targets, owned by the platform hub.

# The composition root sets `[cell_aliases] toolchains = <platformHubCell>`
# (`composition/root/composition-root.ts`), so prelude's conventional
# `toolchains//:<lang>` spelling resolves into *this* package for every member cell in the
# composed workspace. Prelude rules used by any member therefore find exactly one instance
# of each conventional toolchain, and it is the hub's capability-backed one. Keeping them
# here preserves `05-composition/spec.md:51-56` ("the root carries no synthetic toolchains
# or `none` cell").
